Executive Summary
A modern, cloud-native infrastructure is proposed for your application that balances low operating cost at launch with the ability to scale linearly as traffic grows. The design is deliberately opinionated yet lightweight: fully managed AWS services (ECS on Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, S3/CloudFront) eliminate server maintenance while Terraform keeps the entire stack reproducible. Security guardrails—AWS WAF, IAM least-privilege, Secrets Manager rotation, multi-AZ data stores, and continuous posture scanning—are baked in from day one to satisfy common compliance baselines without heavy overhead.

At minimum load the platform runs for roughly $150–$250 per month, but with horizontal auto-scaling it can reach ~10 000 RPS before you need structural changes (e.g., sharding Redis, promoting RDS read replicas, or going multi-region). The phased implementation plan allows an intermediate-level team to stand up production, staging, and CI/CD pipelines in under six weeks while continuously validating costs, performance, and security.

2. Networking  
   • Single-region /16 VPC across 2 AZs  
   • Public subnets: ALB, NAT GW, bastion (optional)  
   • Private subnets: Fargate ENIs, RDS, Redis  
   • Security Groups:  
     – ALB: :80/:443 inbound, 0.0.0.0/0 outbound  
     – ECS: ALB SG inbound only  
     – RDS: ECS SG inbound only  
   • IPv6 disabled initially (simpler IAM/WAF); enable when needed.

3. Compute (ECS on Fargate)  
   • One cluster, one service per micro-app.  
   • Task definition v1: 0.5 vCPU / 1 GiB RAM, two tasks + 1 standby.  
   • Auto-Scaling policies:  
     – ALB RequestCountPerTarget > 100 → +1 task  
     – CPU > 70 % for 5 min → +1 task  
     – Scale-in cooldown 300 s.  
   • Rolling or Blue/Green deploys via CodeDeploy.

4. Data Layer  
   • RDS PostgreSQL 15.4, db.t3.micro Multi-AZ, 20 GiB gp3, 7-day PITR.  
   • Upgrade path: db.r6g.large, 100 GiB, read-replicas → Aurora.  
   • ElastiCache Redis 7.x, cache.t3.micro (no multi-AZ). Upgrade to cluster-mode enabled at 2 % eviction.  
   • S3: Versioning, default encryption (SSE-S3), lifecycle IA→Glacier, Cross-Region Replication (disabled until DR phase).

5. CI/CD & IaC  
   • GitHub Actions → Build, unit tests, Docker build, image scan (Trivy), push to ECR.  
   • Terraform 1.8 in Terraform Cloud with OPA policy checks; plans require PR approval.  
   • CodeDeploy Blue/Green with automatic rollback on 5xx or latency alarms.

6. Observability  
   • CloudWatch Container Insights, Logs, and X-Ray tracing.  
   • Alarms: p95 latency > 500 ms 5 min, HTTP 5xx > 1 %, CPU > 80 %, DB connections > 80 %.  
   • SNS → PagerDuty, Slack.  
   • Cost Explorer budget alert at 120 % of forecast.

7. Security & Compliance  
   • IAM roles scoped per service; no secret keys in code.  
   • AWS WAF (OWASP Core Rule Set) + rate-limit 1 000 req/min/IP.  
   • TLS: ACM certs (RSA 2048, validated via DNS).  
   • Secrets Manager rotation: RDS creds every 30 days (Lambda rotation function).  
   • AWS Backup plans: RDS daily, S3 monthly full.

Implementation Timeline
Phase 0 — Project Foundations (Week 0-1)  
   • Create separate AWS accounts (prod, staging, shared-services).  
   • Set up Terraform Cloud org, state back-end, and GitHub repo.  
   • Configure org-wide CloudTrail and SecurityHub.

Phase 1 — Core Networking & IAM (Week 1-2)  
   • Terraform VPC, subnets, NAT, SGs.  
   • Bootstrap IAM roles, Terraform service role, CI/CD OIDC trust.  
   • Manual validation: VPC reachability, subnet tagging.

Phase 2 — Data Layer (Week 2-3)  
   • Deploy RDS PostgreSQL and ElastiCache Redis (staging first).  
   • Configure automated backups, parameter groups.  
   • Load test connection limits; migrate initial schema.

Phase 3 — Compute & ALB (Week 3-4)  
   • Push first container image to ECR; create ECS cluster, service, ALB.  
   • Implement WAF, ACM-based HTTPS.  
   • Run synthetic uptime tests; verify auto-scaling triggers.

Phase 4 — CI/CD Hardening (Week 4-5)  
   • Integrate GitHub Actions → CodeDeploy Blue/Green.  
   • Add image scanning, OPA policy checks, automated Terraform plans.  
   • Conduct rollback drill and game-day exercise.

Phase 5 — Observability & Cost Guardrails (Week 5-6)  
   • Enable X-Ray, set CloudWatch alarms & dashboards.  
   • Configure cost anomaly alerting.  
   • Sign-off: performance test to 1 000 RPS sustained.

Phase 6 — Optional Enhancements (post-launch)  
   • Cross-Region S3 replication, Route 53 DR, Redis sharding, Aurora migration as traffic dictates.

Resource Requirements
1. Team  
   • Cloud/DevOps Engineer (lead) – 0.8 FTE for 6 weeks  
   • Application Developer rep – 0.4 FTE for containerization, health checks  
   • Security Engineer – 0.2 FTE for IAM/WAF reviews  
   • Project Manager/Scrum Master – 0.2 FTE

2. Tooling (all pay-as-you-go)  
   • AWS (see cost table below)  
   • Terraform Cloud Team & Governance plan: $20/user-month (~$100)  
   • PagerDuty Essentials: $19/user-month (on-call only)  
   • GitHub (existing)  

3. Budget Estimate (steady-state, low traffic)  
   • Fargate tasks (2 × 0.5 vCPU/1 GiB)……. $ 35  
   • ALB + WAF + ACM………………………… $ 40  
   • RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ t3.micro)…… $ 60  
   • ElastiCache Redis t3.micro ……………… $ 16  
   • NAT Gateway (low egress)……………… $ 35  
   • S3 + CloudFront (≤100 GB/mo)………… $ 10  
   • CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS………………… $ 15  
   • Total AWS (avg)…………………………… $ 211 / month  
   Non-AWS (TF Cloud, PagerDuty)…………… $ 120 / month  
   Contingency (20 %)………………………… $ 65  
   GRAND TOTAL………………………………… ≈ $ 400 / month

Risk Assessment
1. Cost Overrun  
   • Risk: NAT data transfer, ALB LCUs spike with bot traffic.  
   • Mitigation: Enable WAF rate-limits, set AWS Budgets alert at 110 %.  
2. Mis-configured IAM leading to privilege escalation  
   • Mitigation: Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer, least-privilege Terraform modules, quarterly review.  
3. State loss due to inadequate backups  
   • Mitigation: Cross-validate nightly RDS snapshot restores in staging; enforce backup policies via AWS Config.  
4. Scaling bottleneck in database before application tier  
   • Mitigation: Monitor CPU and IOPS; pre-create read replica; plan Aurora migration playbook.  
5. Single-region outage  
   • Mitigation: Document DR plan (S3 replication, DNS fail-over); schedule multi-region exercise by Q3.

Recommendations (Priority-Ordered)
1. Stand up the Terraform baseline (Phase 0-1) immediately—this unlocks gated progress for all other phases.  
2. Containerize the application early to validate health checks and ECS integration.  
3. Keep Fargate task size small at launch; rely on auto-scaling first, vertical scaling second.  
4. Do not enable cross-region replication or Aurora until CloudWatch reports >50 % average RDS CPU or business requires RTO < 1 h.  
5. Enforce PR-based Terraform workflows with OPA policies from day one; retrofitting governance later is costly.  
6. Schedule quarterly security posture reviews and bi-annual DR tests.  
7. Re-evaluate architecture at 50 % of any soft limit (20 tasks, 60 % RDS CPU, 2 % Redis eviction) to stay ahead of growth.

This plan provides a clear path from zero to production-ready infrastructure, emphasizing security, scalability, and maintainability while controlling cost and complexity for an intermediate-level team.

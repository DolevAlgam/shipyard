All agents bypass the well-designed `SummarizerAgent` and use primitive keyword-matching `_extract_summary()` methods that cannot understand semantic meaning.\n\n**CRITICAL EVIDENCE OF KEYWORD-BASED SUMMARY FAILURES**:\n\n1. **Business Agent Bug** (`agents/business.py` lines 117-137):\n   ```python\n   if any(scale in content for scale in [\"thousand\", \"million\", \"hundred\", \"k\", \"m\"]):\n       summary[\"user_scale\"] = message[\"content\"]  # Stores entire message!\n   ```\n   **Result**: User says \"I have 15 properties, expecting 1000 users daily\" → summary stores entire message as \"user_scale\" instead of extracting \"15 properties\" and \"1000 daily users\"\n\n2. **App Agent Bug** (`agents/app.py` lines 117-147):\n   ```python\n   if any(lang in content for lang in languages):\n       summary[\"programming_languages\"] = message[\"content\"]\n   ```\n   **Result**: User says \"I prefer Python but might use JavaScript for frontend\" → summary stores entire message instead of extracting structured language preferences\n\n3. **All Agents Use Same Broken Pattern**:\n   - Tribal, Profiler, Feedback agents all use keyword detection + store entire message\n   - No semantic understanding of actual values, quantities, or relationships\n   - Information gets lost in noise instead of clean structured extraction\n\n**REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (Dependent on Task #16 completion):\n\n1. **PREREQUISITE: Complete Task #16 First**:\n   - Remove ALL `_extract_summary()` methods from all agent files\n   - Force all agents to use `SummarizerAgent.summarize_pillar()` exclusively\n   - Eliminate all keyword-based extraction logic\n\n2. **Enhanced SummarizerAgent Prompts for Structured Data Extraction**:\n   - Update `core/prompts.py` SUMMARIZER_PROMPT with specific value extraction instructions:\n     - \"Extract specific numerical values with units (e.g., '15 properties', '$200/month', '2GB videos')\"\n     - \"Distinguish between 'no budget specified' vs '$50k budget'\"\n     - \"Capture exact technical terms mentioned by user\"\n     - \"Structure output according to the defined schema\"\n\n3. **Implement Structured Summary Format**:\n   - Update `agents/summarizer.py` with standardized output schema:\n   ```python\n   SUMMARY_SCHEMA = {\n       \"extracted_values\": {\n           \"user_counts\": \"specific numbers (e.g., 1000 daily users)\",\n           \"budget_amounts\": \"exact figures (e.g., $200/month, $50k total)\",\n           \"storage_needs\": \"capacity requirements (e.g., 2GB videos, 500MB files)\",\n           \"timelines\": \"specific dates and deadlines\"\n       },\n       \"technical_specs\": {\n           \"frameworks\": \"mentioned technologies\",\n           \"databases\": \"specific database choices\",\n           \"cloud_providers\": \"AWS, Azure, GCP preferences\",\n           \"compliance\": \"GDPR, HIPAA, SOX requirements\"\n       },\n       \"business_context\": {\n           \"industry\": \"user's business domain\",\n           \"use_cases\": \"primary application purposes\",\n           \"constraints\": \"limitations and requirements\"\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Cross-Pillar Information Synthesis**:\n   - Implement logic in `SummarizerAgent` to merge related information mentioned across different pillars\n   - Add validation to prevent duplicate or conflicting information\n   - Create cross-reference system to link related details (e.g., video storage mentioned in both business and app pillars)\n\n5. **Summary Quality Validation**:\n   - Add validation checks to ensure summaries contain actual extracted values, not full message content\n   - Implement logic to verify critical information isn't lost during summarization\n   - Add fallback mechanisms for edge cases and ambiguous user responses",

Compare actual vs expected behavior for each persona and project type.\n\n4. **Context Retention Validation**: Execute test conversations containing specific data points (user counts, budgets, timelines, technology choices) and verify that all information appears correctly in final documents without loss or misinterpretation.\n\n5. **Platform-Specific Testing**: Test each supported platform (Railway, AWS, Vercel, etc.) with identical user inputs to ensure platform-specific recommendations are accurate and mutually exclusive. Validate that mixed platform setups receive appropriate hybrid recommendations.\n\n6. **Agent Integration Testing**: Verify that all agents properly use SummarizerAgent.summarize_pillar() and that context passing uses structured data rather than JSON dumps.\n\n7. **Value Preservation Testing**: Track specific numerical values, technology choices, and constraints through the entire interview flow to ensure no data loss or corruption occurs.\n\n8. **Regression Testing**: Maintain a baseline of expected outputs for each test scenario and automatically detect when changes introduce regressions in conversation quality or document accuracy. Pay special attention to interactions between different bug fixes.\n\n9. **Manual Validation**: Conduct human review of generated documents for coherence, technical accuracy, and alignment with stated user requirements.\n\n10. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure and document response times, memory usage, and API call efficiency across all test scenarios to establish performance baselines.\n\n11. **Bug Documentation**: Create detailed bug reports with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, conversation logs, and impact assessment for any identified issues.\n\n12. **Fix Validation Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports showing which bug fixes are working correctly and which may need additional attention.",

Agents cannot intelligently avoid repetition because keyword-based logic cannot understand semantic relationships between previously provided information.\n\n**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The repetitive questioning and poor intelligence is directly caused by:\n\n1. **Follow-Up Detection Uses Keywords, Not Context**:\n   - `utils/helpers.py` `needs_follow_up()` checks for hardcoded phrases like \"what do you mean\", \"i don't understand\"\n   - Completely ignores whether information was already provided elsewhere\n   - Example: User says \"2GB videos, 10 minutes\" in profiler → business agent still asks about storage because keyword logic doesn't understand this relates to storage needs\n\n2. **Skip Detection Ignores Semantic Context**:\n   - `is_skip_response()` only checks for literal phrases like \"skip\", \"i don't know\"\n   - Can't understand when user provided relevant information in different words\n   - Example: User says \"We mentioned this earlier\" → keyword logic doesn't recognize this as skip intent\n\n3. **Agents Can't Parse Existing Information**:\n   - All `_extract_summary()` methods store full messages instead of extracting semantic meaning\n   - Agents receive garbled context they can't intelligently parse\n   - Example: Business summary contains \"user said: I have 15 properties...\" instead of structured \"property_count: 15\"\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (Post Task #16 Completion):\n\n1. **Replace Keyword-Based Follow-Up Detection**:\n   - Remove hardcoded phrase matching in `utils/helpers.py`\n   - Implement LLM-based understanding of response completeness:\n     ```python\n     def needs_follow_up_llm(response: str, question: str, existing_context: str) -> bool:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Question: {question}\n         User Response: {response}\n         Existing Context: {existing_context}\n         \n         Does this response fully answer the question considering the existing context?\n         Return: true/false\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Implement Semantic Skip Detection**:\n   - Replace keyword matching with LLM-based intent recognition:\n     ```python\n     def is_skip_response_llm(response: str) -> bool:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         User Response: {response}\n         \n         Is the user indicating they want to skip this question or that the information was already provided?\n         Consider phrases like \"already mentioned\", \"covered this\", \"skip\", etc.\n         Return: true/false\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Enhanced Context-Aware Prompt Engineering**:\n   - Update `core/prompts.py` to include semantic context analysis:\n     - Add \"CRITICAL: Analyze the COMPLETED PILLARS section semantically to understand what information is already available\"\n     - Include \"Do NOT ask for information that can be inferred from previous responses\"\n     - Add \"Build upon existing information with deeper, more specific questions\"\n\n4. **Implement Information Gap Analysis**:\n   - Add LLM-based gap analysis to agent prompts:\n     ```python\n     def _generate_gap_analysis_prompt(self, topic: str, existing_context: str) -> str:\n         return f\"\"\"\n         EXISTING CONTEXT: {existing_context}\n         \n         Analyze what specific information is still needed for {topic}.\n         Consider semantic relationships - if user mentioned \"2GB videos\", don't ask about file sizes.\n         Generate ONE specific question that fills the biggest information gap.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Cross-Agent Semantic Information Mapping**:\n   - Implement LLM-based logic to understand relationships across pillars:\n     ```python\n     def _map_cross_pillar_info_llm(self, state: Dict) -> Dict:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Previous Pillar Summaries: {state.get('summaries', {})}\n         \n         Extract and map related information:\n         - Business metrics (user counts, revenue) → Infrastructure needs\n         - Technical specs (file sizes, formats) → Storage/bandwidth requirements\n         - Constraints (budget, timeline) → Technology choices\n         \n         Return structured mapping of available information.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Intelligent Question Generation**:\n   - Implement context-aware question generation using LLM understanding:\n     ```python\n     def _generate_intelligent_question(self, topic: str, context: Dict) -> str:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Topic: {topic}\n         Available Context: {context}\n         \n         Generate an intelligent question that:\n         1. Builds upon existing information\n         2. Avoids repeating what's already known\n         3. Seeks specific details needed for {topic}\n         \n         Example: If user mentioned \"15 properties\", ask about occupancy rates, not property count.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```",
        "testStrategy": "**PREREQUISITE**: All tests depend on Task #16 completion (removal of keyword-based logic).\n\n1. **Semantic Follow-Up Detection Testing**: Test that LLM-based follow-up detection correctly identifies when responses are complete vs incomplete, considering existing context. Verify it doesn't trigger follow-ups when information was provided in different words.\n\n2. **Context-Aware Question Validation**: Test specific scenarios from root cause analysis - user provides \"2GB, 10 minutes video\" in profiler, verify app agent doesn't re-ask about storage but asks intelligent follow-ups like \"Given your 2GB video files, what's your expected concurrent upload volume?\"\n\n3. **Semantic Skip Detection**: Test that LLM-based skip detection recognizes various ways users indicate information was already provided (\"mentioned earlier\", \"covered this\", \"already told you\") not just literal \"skip\" keywords.\n\n4. **Information Completeness Testing**: Create test cases where users mention specific details (\"15 properties\", \"PostgreSQL database\", \"$50k budget\") to one agent, verify subsequent agents reference these facts instead of re-asking.\n\n5. **Cross-Pillar Semantic Mapping**: Test that technical specs from profiler (video duration, file sizes) are properly understood and connected to infrastructure questions in app pillar through semantic analysis, not keyword matching.\n\n6. **Gap Analysis Testing**: Verify agents correctly identify what information is missing vs what's already provided through semantic understanding, and focus questions on actual gaps.\n\n7. **Repetition Prevention**: Run comprehensive tests ensuring no agent asks for information clearly provided in previous pillars, with specific test cases for common repetition patterns identified in the bug analysis.\n\n8. **Intelligent Question Generation**: Test that agents generate semantically aware questions like \"You mentioned 15 properties - what's the average occupancy rate?\" instead of generic \"How many users do you have?\"",

BaseAgent Violations (CRITICAL)**:\n- `agents/base_agent.py` lines 14-46: Remove `unclear_indicators`, `advanced_terms`, `intermediate_terms` keyword lists\n- Delete `needs_follow_up()` and `extract_expertise_level()` methods that use keyword matching\n- Replace with LLM-based analysis calls\n\n**2. utils/helpers.py Massive Violations**:\n- Lines 18-41: `unclear_indicators` list for follow-up detection\n- Lines 93-104: `error_patterns` for response validation\n- Lines 126-130: Keyword matching for expertise levels\n- Lines 155-177: `skip_phrases` for skip detection\n- Lines 219-242: `advanced_terms`/`intermediate_terms` for complexity\n- **SOLUTION**: Replace ALL functions with dedicated LLM agent calls\n\n**3. All Agent _extract_summary() Methods**:\n- `agents/business.py` lines 117-137: `if any(scale in content for scale in [\"thousand\", \"million\"])`\n- `agents/app.py` lines 117-147: Keyword matching for languages, frameworks, databases\n- `agents/tribal.py` lines 118-142: Provider, tool, expertise keyword detection\n- `agents/profiler.py` lines 162-175: Domain and timeline keyword matching\n- `agents/feedback_interpreter.py` line 109: Change detection keywords\n- **SOLUTION**: Delete ALL _extract_summary methods, force SummarizerAgent LLM calls\n\n**4. Agent Process Logic Violations**:\n- Every agent imports and uses: `needs_follow_up`, `is_skip_response`, `extract_expertise_level`\n- Replace with dedicated LLM agents for each decision point\n\n**REQUIRED LLM REPLACEMENT AGENTS:**\n\n```python\n# 1.

This creates confusion and a poor first impression.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:\n\n**1. Identify and Consolidate Welcome Messages**:\nLocate all welcome message instances in the codebase:\n```python\n# Search for patterns in:\n# - main.py (application entry point)\n# - agents/profiler.py (ProfilerAgent initial message)\n# - core/state_manager.py (initial state setup)\n# - utils/helpers.py (any welcome message utilities)\n```\n\n**2. Create Unified Welcome Message Handler**:\nIn `core/welcome_handler.py`:\n```python\nclass WelcomeHandler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.welcome_shown = False\n    \n    def get_welcome_message(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Return the single, unified welcome message\"\"\"\n        if self.welcome_shown:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        self.welcome_shown = True\n        return \"\"\"\nWelcome to the Infrastructure Interview Agent! 🚀\n\nI'm here to help you design the perfect infrastructure for your project. \nThrough a series of focused conversations, I'll gather all the information \nneeded to create a comprehensive infrastructure plan tailored to your needs.\n\nLet's begin by understanding you and your project.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    def reset(self):\n        \"\"\"Reset welcome state for new sessions\"\"\"\n        self.welcome_shown = False\n```\n\n**3. Remove Redundant Messages from ProfilerAgent**:\nUpdate `agents/profiler.py`:\n```python\nclass ProfilerAgent(BaseAgent):\n    def __init__(self, openai_client):\n        super().__init__(openai_client)\n        # Remove any hardcoded welcome messages\n        \n    def get_initial_message(self) -> str:\n        # Instead of \"Let me start by understanding you...\"\n        return \"First, I'd like to know a bit about your background and experience level.\"\n```\n\n**4.

Session Flow Testing**:\n- Run complete interview flow from start to finish\n- Verify welcome appears only at application start\n- Test that restarting interview doesn't show welcome again in same session\n- Confirm new session (application restart) shows welcome once\n\n**3. Agent Transition Testing**:\n- Test transitions between all agents (Profiler → Business → App → etc.)\n- Verify no agent introduces itself with welcome-like messages\n- Confirm transitions are smooth with contextual messages only\n- Test that each agent starts with its specific questions immediately\n\n**4. State Management Verification**:\n- Check StateManager tracks welcome_shown flag correctly\n- Verify flag persists throughout session\n- Test reset functionality clears welcome state for new sessions\n- Confirm no state corruption affects welcome display\n\n**5. Edge Case Testing**:\n- Test application crash and restart (should show welcome again)\n- Test multiple concurrent sessions (each should have independent welcome state)\n- Verify error handling doesn't trigger duplicate welcomes\n- Test with SHOW_WELCOME_MESSAGE=false in config\n\n**6. User Experience Validation**:\n- Conduct user testing to confirm improved flow\n- Measure time to first meaningful interaction (should be faster)\n- Verify no user confusion about application state\n- Confirm professional, polished first impression\n\n**7. Code Search Verification**:\n- Search codebase for any remaining \"Let me start by understanding\" strings\n- Verify no hardcoded welcome messages in individual agents\n- Confirm all welcome logic centralized in WelcomeHandler\n- Check for any console.log or print statements with welcome text\n\n**8. Integration Testing**:\n- Test with all dependent systems (OpenAI client, State Manager, etc.)\n- Verify welcome handler integrates cleanly with existing architecture\n- Test with different OpenAI models to ensure consistency\n- Confirm no regression in other functionality",

        "description": "Fix critical bug where agents continuously respond to their own \"Let me ask a follow-up question to clarify...\" text, treating it as user input and creating an infinite conversation loop that makes the system completely unusable.",
        "details": "**CRITICAL INFINITE LOOP BUG - SYSTEM BREAKING**\n\n**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:\nThe system is incorrectly processing agent-generated clarification text (\"Let me ask a follow-up question to clarify...\") as if it were user input, causing agents to respond to themselves in an endless loop. This indicates fundamental flaws in:\n1. Input/output stream separation\n2. Message source identification\n3. Conversation state management\n4. Async processing boundaries\n\n**INVESTIGATION AREAS**:\n\n**1. Input Handler Contamination** (`ui/input_handler.py`):\n```python\n# Check for issues where agent output is being fed back as input:\n- Verify input buffer is properly cleared after user submission\n- Ensure agent responses are not written to input stream\n- Check for race conditions in async input processing\n- Validate that only actual user keyboard input triggers processing\n```\n\n**2. Conversation Flow Management** (`core/conversation_manager.py` or similar):\n```python\n# Identify where message source tracking fails:\nclass Message:\n    def __init__(self, content: str, source: str, timestamp: float):\n        self.content = content\n        self.source = source  # 'user' or 'agent'\n        self.timestamp = timestamp\n        \n# Ensure proper message source identification:\nasync def process_message(self, message: Message):\n    if message.source != 'user':\n        return  # Never process non-user messages as input\n```\n\n**3. Agent Response Processing** (`agents/base_agent.py`):\n```python\n# Fix areas where agent output might be misinterpreted:\nasync def ask_follow_up(self, question: str):\n    # Mark this as agent-generated content\n    self.display_agent_message(question)\n    \n    # Wait for ONLY user input\n    user_response = await self.wait_for_user_input()\n    \n    # Validate response is actually from user\n    if not self.is_user_generated(user_response):\n        raise ValueError(\"Received non-user input in user response flow\")\n```\n\n**4. Async Event Loop Issues**:\n```python\n# Check for async processing bugs:\n- Race conditions between output display and input collection\n- Event loop contamination where callbacks trigger on wrong events\n- Missing await statements causing premature execution\n- Improper task cancellation leaving orphaned handlers\n```\n\n**5. State Machine Fixes**:\n```python\nclass ConversationState(Enum):\n    WAITING_FOR_USER = \"waiting_for_user\"\n    PROCESSING_USER_INPUT = \"processing_user_input\"\n    GENERATING_AGENT_RESPONSE = \"generating_agent_response\"\n    DISPLAYING_AGENT_OUTPUT = \"displaying_agent_output\"\n\n# Enforce strict state transitions:\nasync def transition_state(self, new_state: ConversationState):\n    valid_transitions = {\n        ConversationState.WAITING_FOR_USER: [ConversationState.PROCESSING_USER_INPUT],\n        ConversationState.PROCESSING_USER_INPUT: [ConversationState.GENERATING_AGENT_RESPONSE],\n        ConversationState.GENERATING_AGENT_RESPONSE: [ConversationState.DISPLAYING_AGENT_OUTPUT],\n        ConversationState.DISPLAYING_AGENT_OUTPUT: [ConversationState.WAITING_FOR_USER]\n    }\n    \n    if new_state not in valid_transitions.get(self.current_state, []):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid state transition: {self.current_state} -> {new_state}\")\n```\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:\n\n1. **Add Message Source Tracking**:\n   - Implement explicit source identification for all messages\n   - Add validation to prevent agent messages from entering input pipeline\n   - Create clear boundaries between user and agent message flows\n\n2. **Fix Input Collection**:\n   - Ensure input handler only processes actual keyboard/user events\n   - Add guards to prevent any agent-generated text from being treated as input\n   - Implement input source validation\n\n3. **Implement Conversation Lock**:\n   ```python\n   class ConversationLock:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.is_waiting_for_user = False\n           self.lock = asyncio.Lock()\n       \n       async def wait_for_user_input(self):\n           async with self.lock:\n               self.is_waiting_for_user = True\n               try:\n                   # Only accept input when explicitly waiting\n                   user_input = await self.get_user_input()\n                   return user_input\n               finally:\n                   self.is_waiting_for_user = False\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Debug Logging**:\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   \n   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n   \n   async def process_input(self, text: str, source: str):\n       logger.debug(f\"Processing input: source={source}, text_preview={text[:50]}...\")\n       if source != 'user':\n           logger.error(f\"CRITICAL: Non-user input detected: {source}\")\n           raise ValueError(\"Attempted to process non-user input\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Emergency Circuit Breaker**:\n   ```python\n   class ConversationCircuitBreaker:\n       def __init__(self, max_consecutive_agent_responses=2):\n           self.consecutive_agent_responses = 0\n           self.max_allowed = max_consecutive_agent_responses\n       \n       def record_response(self, source: str):\n           if source == 'agent':\n               self.consecutive_agent_responses += 1\n               if self.consecutive_agent_responses > self.max_allowed:\n                   raise RuntimeError(\"EMERGENCY STOP: Detected agent self-response loop\")\n           else:\n               self.consecutive_agent_responses = 0\n   ```\n\n**CRITICAL FIX LOCATIONS**:\n- `ui/input_handler.py`: Add source validation\n- `agents/base_agent.py`: Fix follow-up question handling\n- `core/conversation_manager.py`: Implement state machine\n- `main.py` or orchestration loop: Add circuit breaker",

Excess newlines in buffer triggering empty responses\n2. Agents interpreting buffered newlines as user input\n3. Infinite conversation loops from processing buffered data\n4. System becoming unusable due to continuous empty responses\n\n**IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION - RICH LIBRARY APPROACH**:\n\n**1. Added Rich Dependency**:\n- Added `rich>=13.0.0` to requirements.txt\n- Industry-standard library for terminal UI and input handling\n\n**2. Simplified Input Handler** (`utils/helpers.py`):\n```python\nfrom rich.prompt import Prompt\n\ndef get_user_input(prompt=\"\"):\n    \"\"\"Get user input using Rich library for robust handling.\"\"\"\n    return Prompt.ask(prompt) if prompt else Prompt.ask()\n```\n\n**3. Benefits Over Buffer Draining**:\n- ✅ **Simpler**: 3 lines vs 50+ lines of terminal manipulation\n- ✅ **More reliable**: Industry-standard library vs custom buffer hacks\n- ✅ **Zero data loss risk**: No manual buffer clearing that could lose user input\n- ✅ **Better UX**: Prettier prompts, proper multi-line handling\n- ✅ **Future-proof**: Handles entire class of terminal input issues\n- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Works perfectly on Windows, macOS, and Linux\n\n**4. Multi-line Paste Handling**:\n- Rich treats pasted content as single input instead of multiple Enter presses\n- No more infinite loops from buffered newlines\n- Graceful handling of all edge cases\n\n**5. Zero Agent Changes Required**:\n- All agents already use `get_user_input()` function\n- No modifications needed to ProfilerAgent, BusinessAgent, AppAgent, or TribalAgent\n- Drop-in replacement solution\n\n**ADDITIONAL BENEFITS**:\n\n**1. Enhanced User Experience**:\n- Colored prompts for better visibility\n- Proper cursor handling\n- Better input validation built-in\n- Consistent behavior across all platforms\n\n**2.

Failing to recognize when to transition to the next pillar\n4. Mixing interview and recommendation phases\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**:\n\n**OPTION 1: Enhanced Agent Prompts with Recommendation-Question Pattern (Primary Fix)**\n\n**1. Update Agent Prompt Framework**:\nModify `core/prompts.py` to implement recommendation-question pattern:\n```python\nRECOMMENDATION_QUESTION_FRAMEWORK = \"\"\"\nCRITICAL INTERVIEW PROTOCOL:\n1.

If so, I can include ECS auto-scaling in your plan.\"\n3. Framework: \"Is [recommendation] something you'd want to prioritize?\" → [If yes, include in document]\n4. Always gauge user interest before making assumptions\n5. Every response MUST end with a question to maintain conversation flow\n\nEXAMPLES OF CORRECT PATTERNS:\n- \"Is high availability a priority for you?

Recommendation-Question Pattern Testing**:\n- Test agent responses for proper pattern usage:\n  - Input: \"I need high availability\"\n  - Expected: \"Is 99.99% uptime something you'd want to prioritize? I can include multi-AZ strategies if needed.\"\n  - NOT: \"You should implement multi-AZ deployment with RDS...\"\n- Verify all agents follow the pattern consistently\n- Test edge cases where recommendations might naturally arise\n\n**2. Auto-Transition Safety Net Testing**:\n- Test responses without questions trigger safety net:\n  - Agent response: \"I understand your requirements.\"\n  - Expected auto-append: \"Is there anything else about [topic] you'd like to discuss, or should we move to [next]?\"\n- Verify safety net activation rate stays below 10% in normal conversations\n- Test GPT-4o validation speed (should be <500ms)\n\n**3. Acknowledgment Response Testing**:\n- Test with various acknowledgment phrases: \"okay\", \"yes\", \"got it\", \"understood\"\n- Verify smooth transitions without repetitive questioning\n- Test compound acknowledgments: \"okay, let's continue\" → should transition\n- Test false positives: \"okay, but I also need...\" → should NOT transition\n\n**4. Question Presence Validation**:\n- Test validator correctly identifies questions:\n  - \"What's your budget range?\" → YES\n  - \"Is scalability important to you?\" → YES\n  - \"I understand your needs.\" → NO\n  - \"That makes sense. Would you like to add more details?\" → YES\n- Test semantic question detection without question marks\n\n**5. End-to-End Flow Testing**:\n- Run complete interview with recommendation-question pattern\n- Verify no implementation details leak into interview phase\n- Confirm all user interests are properly gauged\n- Test that document generation includes only confirmed priorities\n\n**6. Pattern Consistency Testing**:\n- Verify all agents consistently use the pattern\n- Test pattern works across different topics:\n  - Technical: \"Is containerization something you'd want to explore?\"\n  - Business: \"Would 24/7 support be a priority for your team?\"\n  - Organizational: \"Is having a dedicated DevOps team feasible?\"\n\n**7. Transition Smoothness Testing**:\n- Test natural flow between topics and pillars\n- Verify transition questions are contextually appropriate\n- Test no jarring jumps between subjects\n- Confirm state properly tracks covered topics\n\n**8. Edge Case Testing**:\n- User asks \"What would you recommend?\" during interview\n- Expected: \"I'll provide detailed recommendations after understanding all your needs. Is [specific aspect] something you'd want me to prioritize?\"\n- Test interruption scenarios\n- Test very short user responses\n\n**9. Performance Testing**:\n- Measure response time with validator (target <500ms overhead)\n- Test concurrent interviews maintain proper flow\n- Verify no memory leaks in validator\n- Monitor safety net activation rates\n\n**10. Regression Testing**:\n- Verify fix doesn't break existing context sharing (Task 11)\n- Ensure LLM-first approach is maintained (Task 16)\n- Confirm state management works properly (Task 2)\n- Test orchestration loop handles new flow correctly (Task 8)\n\n**11. User Experience Testing**:\n- Conduct user testing to verify natural conversation flow\n- Test that recommendation-questions feel consultative, not pushy\n- Verify users understand they're being asked about priorities\n- Confirm final document reflects only discussed priorities\n\n**12. Monitoring and Metrics Testing**:\n- Verify safety net activation tracking works\n- Test logging captures all validation events\n- Confirm metrics help identify agents needing prompt improvements\n- Test alert thresholds for high safety net usage",

            "details": "<info added on 2025-07-13T03:50:00.850Z>\nThe lightweight question validator has been designed to automatically detect and flag responses that violate the recommendation-question framework. The validator will be integrated into the agent response pipeline to ensure all interactive agents maintain proper interview protocol.\n\n**Validator Implementation Plan:**\n\nThe validator will check each agent response for:\n- Presence of implementation details or direct advice\n- Proper recommendation-question pattern usage\n- Response ending with a question\n- Absence of forbidden patterns like \"You should\", \"I recommend\", or \"Here's how to\"\n\n**Key Validation Rules:**\n1. Must detect direct advice patterns: \"You should\", \"You need to\", \"I recommend\", \"Here's how\"\n2. Must verify recommendation-question format: \"Is [feature] something you'd want to prioritize?\"\n3. Must ensure response ends with a question mark\n4. Must flag responses containing implementation details during interview phase\n5. Must allow transition phrases when user explicitly requests next topic\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Will be called after each agent generates a response but before returning to user\n- Will log violations for monitoring and debugging\n- Can optionally reformat responses to comply with framework\n- Will track violation patterns to identify agents needing prompt refinement\n\n**Expected Impact:**\nThis validator will serve as a safety net to catch any responses that slip through despite the updated prompts, ensuring consistent interview behavior across all agents and preventing premature implementation advice.\n</info added on 2025-07-13T03:50:00.850Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-13T03:56:25.777Z>\n**Response Format Fix Applied to Validator**\n\nThe validator has been updated to detect and flag the robotic quoted dialogue formatting issue discovered during testing. This ensures agents communicate naturally without wrapping their responses in quotes.\n\n**New Validation Rule Added:**\n- Must detect quoted dialogue patterns: responses starting/ending with quotation marks\n- Must flag responses formatted as script dialogue\n- Must ensure natural conversational tone without quote wrapping\n\n**Examples of What Validator Will Flag:**\n- ❌ \"Could you share your experience level with cloud infrastructure?\"\n- ❌ 'What kind of database are you planning to use?'\n- ❌ \"I understand. Let me ask you about...\"\n\n**Expected Natural Format:**\n- ✅ Could you share your experience level with cloud infrastructure?\n- ✅ What kind of database are you planning to use?\n- ✅ I understand. Let me ask you about...\n\n**Implementation Note:**\nSince the RECOMMENDATION_QUESTION_FRAMEWORK now includes explicit response format instructions preventing quoted dialogue, the validator serves as an additional safety check to catch any responses that might still slip through with this formatting issue.\n</info added on 2025-07-13T03:56:25.777Z>",

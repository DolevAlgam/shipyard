All agents bypass the well-designed `SummarizerAgent` and use primitive keyword-matching `_extract_summary()` methods that cannot understand semantic meaning.\n\n**CRITICAL EVIDENCE OF KEYWORD-BASED SUMMARY FAILURES**:\n\n1. **Business Agent Bug** (`agents/business.py` lines 117-137):\n   ```python\n   if any(scale in content for scale in [\"thousand\", \"million\", \"hundred\", \"k\", \"m\"]):\n       summary[\"user_scale\"] = message[\"content\"]  # Stores entire message!\n   ```\n   **Result**: User says \"I have 15 properties, expecting 1000 users daily\" → summary stores entire message as \"user_scale\" instead of extracting \"15 properties\" and \"1000 daily users\"\n\n2. **App Agent Bug** (`agents/app.py` lines 117-147):\n   ```python\n   if any(lang in content for lang in languages):\n       summary[\"programming_languages\"] = message[\"content\"]\n   ```\n   **Result**: User says \"I prefer Python but might use JavaScript for frontend\" → summary stores entire message instead of extracting structured language preferences\n\n3. **All Agents Use Same Broken Pattern**:\n   - Tribal, Profiler, Feedback agents all use keyword detection + store entire message\n   - No semantic understanding of actual values, quantities, or relationships\n   - Information gets lost in noise instead of clean structured extraction\n\n**REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (Dependent on Task #16 completion):\n\n1. **PREREQUISITE: Complete Task #16 First**:\n   - Remove ALL `_extract_summary()` methods from all agent files\n   - Force all agents to use `SummarizerAgent.summarize_pillar()` exclusively\n   - Eliminate all keyword-based extraction logic\n\n2. **Enhanced SummarizerAgent Prompts for Structured Data Extraction**:\n   - Update `core/prompts.py` SUMMARIZER_PROMPT with specific value extraction instructions:\n     - \"Extract specific numerical values with units (e.g., '15 properties', '$200/month', '2GB videos')\"\n     - \"Distinguish between 'no budget specified' vs '$50k budget'\"\n     - \"Capture exact technical terms mentioned by user\"\n     - \"Structure output according to the defined schema\"\n\n3. **Implement Structured Summary Format**:\n   - Update `agents/summarizer.py` with standardized output schema:\n   ```python\n   SUMMARY_SCHEMA = {\n       \"extracted_values\": {\n           \"user_counts\": \"specific numbers (e.g., 1000 daily users)\",\n           \"budget_amounts\": \"exact figures (e.g., $200/month, $50k total)\",\n           \"storage_needs\": \"capacity requirements (e.g., 2GB videos, 500MB files)\",\n           \"timelines\": \"specific dates and deadlines\"\n       },\n       \"technical_specs\": {\n           \"frameworks\": \"mentioned technologies\",\n           \"databases\": \"specific database choices\",\n           \"cloud_providers\": \"AWS, Azure, GCP preferences\",\n           \"compliance\": \"GDPR, HIPAA, SOX requirements\"\n       },\n       \"business_context\": {\n           \"industry\": \"user's business domain\",\n           \"use_cases\": \"primary application purposes\",\n           \"constraints\": \"limitations and requirements\"\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Cross-Pillar Information Synthesis**:\n   - Implement logic in `SummarizerAgent` to merge related information mentioned across different pillars\n   - Add validation to prevent duplicate or conflicting information\n   - Create cross-reference system to link related details (e.g., video storage mentioned in both business and app pillars)\n\n5. **Summary Quality Validation**:\n   - Add validation checks to ensure summaries contain actual extracted values, not full message content\n   - Implement logic to verify critical information isn't lost during summarization\n   - Add fallback mechanisms for edge cases and ambiguous user responses",

Compare actual vs expected behavior for each persona and project type.\n\n4. **Context Retention Validation**: Execute test conversations containing specific data points (user counts, budgets, timelines, technology choices) and verify that all information appears correctly in final documents without loss or misinterpretation.\n\n5. **Platform-Specific Testing**: Test each supported platform (Railway, AWS, Vercel, etc.) with identical user inputs to ensure platform-specific recommendations are accurate and mutually exclusive. Validate that mixed platform setups receive appropriate hybrid recommendations.\n\n6. **Agent Integration Testing**: Verify that all agents properly use SummarizerAgent.summarize_pillar() and that context passing uses structured data rather than JSON dumps.\n\n7. **Value Preservation Testing**: Track specific numerical values, technology choices, and constraints through the entire interview flow to ensure no data loss or corruption occurs.\n\n8. **Regression Testing**: Maintain a baseline of expected outputs for each test scenario and automatically detect when changes introduce regressions in conversation quality or document accuracy. Pay special attention to interactions between different bug fixes.\n\n9. **Manual Validation**: Conduct human review of generated documents for coherence, technical accuracy, and alignment with stated user requirements.\n\n10. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure and document response times, memory usage, and API call efficiency across all test scenarios to establish performance baselines.\n\n11. **Bug Documentation**: Create detailed bug reports with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, conversation logs, and impact assessment for any identified issues.\n\n12. **Fix Validation Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports showing which bug fixes are working correctly and which may need additional attention.",

Agents cannot intelligently avoid repetition because keyword-based logic cannot understand semantic relationships between previously provided information.\n\n**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The repetitive questioning and poor intelligence is directly caused by:\n\n1. **Follow-Up Detection Uses Keywords, Not Context**:\n   - `utils/helpers.py` `needs_follow_up()` checks for hardcoded phrases like \"what do you mean\", \"i don't understand\"\n   - Completely ignores whether information was already provided elsewhere\n   - Example: User says \"2GB videos, 10 minutes\" in profiler → business agent still asks about storage because keyword logic doesn't understand this relates to storage needs\n\n2. **Skip Detection Ignores Semantic Context**:\n   - `is_skip_response()` only checks for literal phrases like \"skip\", \"i don't know\"\n   - Can't understand when user provided relevant information in different words\n   - Example: User says \"We mentioned this earlier\" → keyword logic doesn't recognize this as skip intent\n\n3. **Agents Can't Parse Existing Information**:\n   - All `_extract_summary()` methods store full messages instead of extracting semantic meaning\n   - Agents receive garbled context they can't intelligently parse\n   - Example: Business summary contains \"user said: I have 15 properties...\" instead of structured \"property_count: 15\"\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (Post Task #16 Completion):\n\n1. **Replace Keyword-Based Follow-Up Detection**:\n   - Remove hardcoded phrase matching in `utils/helpers.py`\n   - Implement LLM-based understanding of response completeness:\n     ```python\n     def needs_follow_up_llm(response: str, question: str, existing_context: str) -> bool:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Question: {question}\n         User Response: {response}\n         Existing Context: {existing_context}\n         \n         Does this response fully answer the question considering the existing context?\n         Return: true/false\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Implement Semantic Skip Detection**:\n   - Replace keyword matching with LLM-based intent recognition:\n     ```python\n     def is_skip_response_llm(response: str) -> bool:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         User Response: {response}\n         \n         Is the user indicating they want to skip this question or that the information was already provided?\n         Consider phrases like \"already mentioned\", \"covered this\", \"skip\", etc.\n         Return: true/false\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Enhanced Context-Aware Prompt Engineering**:\n   - Update `core/prompts.py` to include semantic context analysis:\n     - Add \"CRITICAL: Analyze the COMPLETED PILLARS section semantically to understand what information is already available\"\n     - Include \"Do NOT ask for information that can be inferred from previous responses\"\n     - Add \"Build upon existing information with deeper, more specific questions\"\n\n4. **Implement Information Gap Analysis**:\n   - Add LLM-based gap analysis to agent prompts:\n     ```python\n     def _generate_gap_analysis_prompt(self, topic: str, existing_context: str) -> str:\n         return f\"\"\"\n         EXISTING CONTEXT: {existing_context}\n         \n         Analyze what specific information is still needed for {topic}.\n         Consider semantic relationships - if user mentioned \"2GB videos\", don't ask about file sizes.\n         Generate ONE specific question that fills the biggest information gap.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Cross-Agent Semantic Information Mapping**:\n   - Implement LLM-based logic to understand relationships across pillars:\n     ```python\n     def _map_cross_pillar_info_llm(self, state: Dict) -> Dict:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Previous Pillar Summaries: {state.get('summaries', {})}\n         \n         Extract and map related information:\n         - Business metrics (user counts, revenue) → Infrastructure needs\n         - Technical specs (file sizes, formats) → Storage/bandwidth requirements\n         - Constraints (budget, timeline) → Technology choices\n         \n         Return structured mapping of available information.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Intelligent Question Generation**:\n   - Implement context-aware question generation using LLM understanding:\n     ```python\n     def _generate_intelligent_question(self, topic: str, context: Dict) -> str:\n         prompt = f\"\"\"\n         Topic: {topic}\n         Available Context: {context}\n         \n         Generate an intelligent question that:\n         1. Builds upon existing information\n         2. Avoids repeating what's already known\n         3. Seeks specific details needed for {topic}\n         \n         Example: If user mentioned \"15 properties\", ask about occupancy rates, not property count.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```",
        "testStrategy": "**PREREQUISITE**: All tests depend on Task #16 completion (removal of keyword-based logic).\n\n1. **Semantic Follow-Up Detection Testing**: Test that LLM-based follow-up detection correctly identifies when responses are complete vs incomplete, considering existing context. Verify it doesn't trigger follow-ups when information was provided in different words.\n\n2. **Context-Aware Question Validation**: Test specific scenarios from root cause analysis - user provides \"2GB, 10 minutes video\" in profiler, verify app agent doesn't re-ask about storage but asks intelligent follow-ups like \"Given your 2GB video files, what's your expected concurrent upload volume?\"\n\n3. **Semantic Skip Detection**: Test that LLM-based skip detection recognizes various ways users indicate information was already provided (\"mentioned earlier\", \"covered this\", \"already told you\") not just literal \"skip\" keywords.\n\n4. **Information Completeness Testing**: Create test cases where users mention specific details (\"15 properties\", \"PostgreSQL database\", \"$50k budget\") to one agent, verify subsequent agents reference these facts instead of re-asking.\n\n5. **Cross-Pillar Semantic Mapping**: Test that technical specs from profiler (video duration, file sizes) are properly understood and connected to infrastructure questions in app pillar through semantic analysis, not keyword matching.\n\n6. **Gap Analysis Testing**: Verify agents correctly identify what information is missing vs what's already provided through semantic understanding, and focus questions on actual gaps.\n\n7. **Repetition Prevention**: Run comprehensive tests ensuring no agent asks for information clearly provided in previous pillars, with specific test cases for common repetition patterns identified in the bug analysis.\n\n8. **Intelligent Question Generation**: Test that agents generate semantically aware questions like \"You mentioned 15 properties - what's the average occupancy rate?\" instead of generic \"How many users do you have?\"",

BaseAgent Violations (CRITICAL)**:\n- `agents/base_agent.py` lines 14-46: Remove `unclear_indicators`, `advanced_terms`, `intermediate_terms` keyword lists\n- Delete `needs_follow_up()` and `extract_expertise_level()` methods that use keyword matching\n- Replace with LLM-based analysis calls\n\n**2. utils/helpers.py Massive Violations**:\n- Lines 18-41: `unclear_indicators` list for follow-up detection\n- Lines 93-104: `error_patterns` for response validation\n- Lines 126-130: Keyword matching for expertise levels\n- Lines 155-177: `skip_phrases` for skip detection\n- Lines 219-242: `advanced_terms`/`intermediate_terms` for complexity\n- **SOLUTION**: Replace ALL functions with dedicated LLM agent calls\n\n**3. All Agent _extract_summary() Methods**:\n- `agents/business.py` lines 117-137: `if any(scale in content for scale in [\"thousand\", \"million\"])`\n- `agents/app.py` lines 117-147: Keyword matching for languages, frameworks, databases\n- `agents/tribal.py` lines 118-142: Provider, tool, expertise keyword detection\n- `agents/profiler.py` lines 162-175: Domain and timeline keyword matching\n- `agents/feedback_interpreter.py` line 109: Change detection keywords\n- **SOLUTION**: Delete ALL _extract_summary methods, force SummarizerAgent LLM calls\n\n**4. Agent Process Logic Violations**:\n- Every agent imports and uses: `needs_follow_up`, `is_skip_response`, `extract_expertise_level`\n- Replace with dedicated LLM agents for each decision point\n\n**REQUIRED LLM REPLACEMENT AGENTS:**\n\n```python\n# 1.

        "details": "**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX: AGENT ROLE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT**\n\nThis task addresses a fundamental violation of the agent role separation principle where information-gathering agents are providing complete infrastructure solutions instead of staying within their designated roles.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:\nThe ProfilerAgent and other information-gathering agents lack explicit constraints in their prompts to prevent solution-giving behavior. This causes role confusion and premature solutioning before all requirements are gathered.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n\n**1. Update ProfilerAgent Prompt (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**:\n```python\n# In core/prompts.py - Update PROFILER_AGENT_PROMPT\nPROFILER_AGENT_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are the ProfilerAgent responsible for understanding the user's project and expertise level.\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- You MUST ONLY gather information about the user's project, expertise, and context\n- DO NOT provide solutions, recommendations, or implementation advice\n- DO NOT suggest technologies, architectures, or infrastructure approaches\n- DO NOT give any technical guidance or best practices\n- If the user asks for solutions, politely redirect: \"I'm currently gathering information about your project.

Add Monitoring and Alerting**:\n```python\n# In core/monitoring.py\nclass RoleBoundaryMonitor:\n    \"\"\"Tracks and reports role boundary violations\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.violations = []\n    \n    def record_violation(self, agent_type: str, violation_details: dict):\n        self.violations.append({\n            \"timestamp\": datetime.now(),\n            \"agent_type\": agent_type,\n            \"details\": violation_details\n        })\n        \n        # Alert if violations exceed threshold\n        recent_violations = [v for v in self.violations \n                           if v[\"timestamp\"] > datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=5)]\n        if len(recent_violations) > 3:\n            self.send_alert(f\"High rate of role boundary violations: {len(recent_violations)} in last 5 minutes\")\n```\n\n**8.

This fix must be deployed immediately as it affects core system behavior\n2. All existing prompts must be audited for solution-giving language\n3. The validation system should be active but not block responses initially (log-only mode)\n4. After validation, gradually move to enforcement mode\n5. Monitor violation rates to ensure agents adapt to new constraints",
        "testStrategy": "**COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY FOR ROLE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT**:\n\n**1. Prompt Constraint Verification**:\n- Verify all information-gathering agent prompts contain explicit \"DO NOT provide solutions\" constraints\n- Check that constraints are clear, unambiguous, and prominently placed\n- Ensure each agent type has role-specific constraint language\n\n**2. Role Boundary Violation Detection Testing**:\n```python\n# Test cases for RoleBoundaryValidator\ntest_violations = [\n    (\"I recommend using AWS Lambda for this\", [\"recommend\", \"AWS\"]),\n    (\"You should consider Kubernetes\", [\"should\", \"consider\"]),\n    (\"The best practice is to use Docker\", [\"best practice\", \"Docker\"]),\n    (\"Azure would be ideal for your needs\", [\"Azure\", \"would be\"]),\n    (\"For cost optimization, I suggest using spot instances\", [\"suggest\"])\n]\n\n# Test that ProfilerAgent responses are caught\nprofiler_response = \"Based on your requirements, I recommend using AWS with Kubernetes\"\nis_valid, violations = RoleBoundaryValidator.validate_response(profiler_response, \"profiler\")\nassert not is_valid\nassert len(violations) > 0\n```\n\n**3. Agent Behavior Testing**:\n- Create test scenarios where users explicitly ask for solutions during information gathering\n- Verify agents redirect appropriately: \"I'm currently gathering information...\"\n- Test that agents maintain conversation flow while avoiding solutions\n\n**4. End-to-End Violation Testing**:\n```python\n# Simulate conversation that triggers violations\ntest_conversation = {\n    \"profiler\": [\n        \"What technology stack should I use?\",\n        \"Can you recommend a database?\",\n        \"What's the best cloud provider?\"\n    ],\n    \"business\": [\n        \"How should I architect for high availability?\",\n        \"What's the recommended scaling strategy?\"\n    ]\n}\n\n# Each should result in information gathering, not solutions\nfor agent_type, questions in test_conversation.items():\n    for question in questions:\n        response = await agent.process_message(question, state, openai_client)\n        is_valid, _ = RoleBoundaryValidator.validate_response(response, agent_type)\n        assert is_valid, f\"{agent_type} provided solutions for: {question}\"\n```\n\n**5. Validation System Testing**:\n- Test pattern matching for all solution-indicating patterns\n- Verify DocumentGeneratorAgent is exempt from validation\n- Test violation logging and reporting functionality\n- Ensure validation doesn't break normal conversation flow\n\n**6. Regeneration Testing**:\n- Test that when violations are detected, the system requests regeneration\n- Verify regenerated responses comply with role boundaries\n- Test that multiple regeneration attempts are handled gracefully\n\n**7. Monitoring and Alerting Testing**:\n- Verify violations are properly logged with full context\n- Test threshold-based alerting (e.g., >3 violations in 5 minutes)\n- Ensure monitoring doesn't impact system performance\n\n**8. Integration Testing**:\n- Run full interview flows with aggressive solution-seeking users\n- Verify all agents maintain role boundaries throughout\n- Test that final document generation still provides comprehensive solutions\n- Ensure role boundaries don't prevent proper information gathering\n\n**9. Regression Testing**:\n- Create test suite that runs after each prompt update\n- Automated checks for solution-giving language in prompts\n- Verify no reintroduction of solution patterns in agent responses\n\n**10. Performance Testing**:\n- Measure impact of validation on response times\n- Test system behavior under high violation rates\n- Verify validation doesn't cause infinite regeneration loops",

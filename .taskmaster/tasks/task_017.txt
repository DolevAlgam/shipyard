# Task ID: 17
# Title: Design Enhanced Agentic Document Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive multi-agent document generation system where specialized agents write different sections (Architecture, Security, Cost Analysis, etc.) and a consolidation agent combines them into professional-grade, detailed infrastructure planning documents.
# Details:
**ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN FOR ENHANCED DOCUMENT GENERATION**:

**1. Multi-Agent Document Generation Architecture**:
- Create specialized document agents in `agents/document/`:
  - `ArchitectureAgent`: Designs system architecture, data flow, component relationships
  - `SecurityAgent`: Analyzes security requirements, compliance, threat modeling
  - `CostAnalysisAgent`: Detailed cost breakdowns, optimization recommendations
  - `ScalabilityAgent`: Performance planning, load testing strategies, scaling patterns
  - `DeploymentAgent`: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, deployment strategies
  - `MonitoringAgent`: Observability, logging, alerting, SLA definitions
  - `DocumentConsolidatorAgent`: Combines all sections into cohesive final document

**2. Advanced Reasoning Integration**:
- Implement `core/reasoning_engine.py` with support for advanced models (o3, o1-preview)
- Use reasoning models for:
  - Initial document planning and section allocation
  - Cross-section consistency validation
  - Final document quality assessment and enhancement
- Implement model selection logic: reasoning models for planning, standard models for content generation

**3. Enhanced Document Structure**:
```python
class DocumentSection:
    def __init__(self, section_type: str, agent_class: str):
        self.section_type = section_type  # "architecture", "security", etc.
        self.agent_class = agent_class
        self.content = ""
        self.metadata = {}
        self.cross_references = []

class EnhancedDocument:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sections = {}
        self.executive_summary = ""
        self.table_of_contents = ""
        self.appendices = {}
        self.total_length_target = 15000  # words minimum
```

**4. Context-Aware Section Generation**:
- Each specialized agent receives full context from all previous pillars
- Implement section interdependency mapping to ensure consistency
- Add cross-referencing system between sections
- Include detailed technical specifications, code examples, and implementation guides

**5. Quality Enhancement Features**:
- Implement document length validation (minimum 15,000 words)
- Add technical depth scoring system
- Include professional formatting with diagrams, tables, and code blocks
- Implement iterative refinement process with quality gates

**6. Integration with Existing System**:
- Extend current `DocumentGeneratorAgent` to orchestrate specialized agents
- Maintain compatibility with existing state management and context flow
- Ensure all bug fixes from Tasks 13, 16 are preserved and enhanced

# Test Strategy:
**1. Multi-Agent Coordination Testing**: Verify each specialized agent generates appropriate content for their domain and that the DocumentConsolidatorAgent successfully combines sections without duplication or inconsistencies. Test with various technology stacks to ensure platform-specific recommendations.

**2. Document Quality Validation**: Implement automated testing for document length (minimum 15,000 words), technical depth scoring, and professional formatting. Verify documents include specific implementation details, code examples, and actionable recommendations rather than generic advice.

**3. Advanced Reasoning Model Integration**: Test that reasoning models (o3/o1-preview) are correctly used for planning phases and final quality enhancement, while standard models handle content generation. Verify model selection logic works correctly and fallback mechanisms function when advanced models are unavailable.

**4. Cross-Section Consistency Testing**: Create test scenarios where information from one section (e.g., architecture decisions) must be reflected in other sections (e.g., security implications, cost impact). Verify the consolidation agent maintains consistency across all sections.

**5. Context Preservation Validation**: Test that each specialized agent receives and utilizes full context from previous interview pillars, ensuring no information loss and that recommendations are tailored to the specific user requirements and technology choices.

**6. Performance and Scalability Testing**: Measure document generation time with multiple agents, test concurrent agent execution, and verify the system can handle complex enterprise-level requirements while maintaining quality and coherence.

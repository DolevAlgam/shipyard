# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Business, App, and Tribal Knowledge Agents
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the three core interview agents that gather business requirements, application needs, and organizational constraints respectively
# Details:
Implement agents/business.py:
```python
from .base_agent import BaseAgent
from core.prompts import BUSINESS_AGENT_PROMPT, BUSINESS_TOPICS

class BusinessAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("business", BUSINESS_TOPICS, BUSINESS_AGENT_PROMPT)
    
    async def process_topic(self, topic: str, state: Dict, openai_client) -> Dict:
        # Adaptive questioning based on expertise
        # Handle topics: user_base, traffic_patterns, availability, etc.
        pass
```

Implement agents/app.py with APP_TOPICS:
- application_type
- programming_languages
- frameworks
- database_requirements
- storage_needs
- external_integrations
- api_requirements
- deployment_model

Implement agents/tribal.py with TRIBAL_TOPICS:
- cloud_provider
- existing_tools
- team_expertise
- security_policies
- operational_preferences
- development_workflow

# Test Strategy:
Test each agent's ability to adapt questions based on user expertise, verify proper topic coverage, and ensure all gathered requirements are stored correctly in state.
